DESCRIPTION
    dbmdeep is a command line utility which can be used to maintain
    DBM::Deep databases. It is possible to view, modify or delete contents
    of the database and you can export to a YAML file or import from one.

    The utility presents an interactive prompt where you enter commands to
    maintain the database, see section INTERACTIVE COMMANDS for more
    details. Commands can also be piped into the tool via STDIN. Example:

     dbmdeep my.db
     my.db> show

    is the same as:
